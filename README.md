# Fake News Detector
In this project, I train a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network to detect fake news from a given news corpus. This project could be practically used by media companies to automatically predict whether the circulating news is fake or not. The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of news-related articles.

Key Objectives:
 * Apply python libraries to import and visualize dataset
 * Perform exploratory data analysis and plot word-cloud
 * Perform text data cleaning such as removing punctuation and stop words
 * Understand the concept of tokenizer.
 * Perform tokenizing and padding on text corpus to feed the deep learning model.
 * Understand the theory and intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM
 * Build and train the deep learning model
 * Access the performance of the trained model
